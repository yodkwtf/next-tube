        I post weekly web dev tutorials and projects to help people as much as I
        can with my low-quality recording setup. I am however constantly trying
        to improve the content as well as the production quality so that
        shouldn't take much time now.

        In the meantime please consider subscribing if you like my work.

        I initially started with front-end tutorials because that's all I knew
        but now I have a great understanding of backend as well as full-stack
        MERN development so expect more advanced tutorials on them soon.

        Thanks for all your support on this channel. I have been wanting to do
        this for a long time and I'm glad we're finally here :)
